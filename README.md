# System Studio Tool Bar

This app will install a system scope toolbar with OWLv2 and SAM.

## Features
In the main Image Studio, we will have a button to run on the entire item:
1. Run OWLv2 using the item's labels
2. Get SAM features from the global SAM service
3. Run the SAM decoder locally (ONNX) to generate masks from the OWLv2 boxes

# Acknowledgements

The original [OWL-ViT](https://github.com/google-research/scenic/tree/main/scenic/projects/owl_vit) and OWLv2 models were developed by Google Research. We greatly appreciate their innovative contributions to open-vocabulary object detection and their commitment to open-source development.

We also use Meta's [SAM2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2) project for segmentation. For more information, you can explore their work on their GitHub repository. We extend our gratitude to the authors and contributors for their efforts in advancing technology and fostering collaboration in AI research.
